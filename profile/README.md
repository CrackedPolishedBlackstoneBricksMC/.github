# THE TOOLING MANIFESTO

* I PLEDGE TO ALWAYS WRITE MINECRAFT TOOLCHAINS TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY
* I WILL ALWAYS CHOOSE QUALITY TOOLING WHENEVER POSSIBLE
* I BELIEVE THAT THE DEVELOPER CAN BE CHALLENGED WITHOUT COMPROMISING ON WHAT IS "USEFUL"
* I AM CREATIVE AND ORGANIZED AND THESE TRAITS ARE APPARENT IN MY CODE
* I WILL NEVER REDUCE MY TOOLS TO BORING "EFFECTIVE JAVA RHETORIC" EVEN WHEN THAT IS POPULAR
* I BELIEVE THAT GOOD DOCUMENTATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF A GOOD PROJECT
* I CAN WRITE TOOLCHAINS THAT ARE FOR DEVELOPERS OF ANY EXPERIENCE LEVEL INCLUDEING THE PROS
* I AM NOT AFRAID TO USE STREAMS OR A LOOP, RECURSION, OR INHERITANCE
* I AM FAMILIAR WITH MODDING STYLES OF OLD AND NEW AND I CAN BRING THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
* I WILL NOT RELEASE A MOD IF I AM NOT HAPPY WITH IT
* I UNDERSTAND THAT GOOD MODS TAKE TIME TO WRITE
* I DO NOT RELEASE MODS WITH THE HOPE OF BEING POPULAR BUT BECAUSE I KNOW WE NEED GOOD MODS
* I WRITE MODS THE WAY I WANT TO WRITE THEM AND NOT WHAT SOMEONE ELSE THINKS
* I AM WILLING TO HELP OTHERS AND BE A GOOD EXAMPLE THROUGH MY TOOLCHAINS
* I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESSIBILITY WHICH IS WHY I MAKE TOOLCHAINS COMPATIBILE WITH ALL GRADLE AND JAVA VERSIONS
* I WILL NEVER WRITE SOFTWARE THAT DOESN'T WORK UNLESS IT IS ARTISTIC
* I HAVE STUDIED THE FORMAT OF FORGE AND FABRIC TOOLCHAINS AND I KNOW HOW TO MAKE THEM BETTER
* I NEVER FORGET TO SET THE ARTIFACT GROUPID, NAME, OR VERSION NUMBER
* I KNOW A GOOD TOOLCHAIN WHEN I SEE ONE AND I FORM MY OWN OPINIONS
* I CAN WRITE TOOLCHAINS TO MAKE THE MODDERS BETTER AT DEVELOPING BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IS GOOD FOR THEM
* I WILL INCLUDE THE TOOLING MANIFESTO IN MY TOOLCHAINS TO HOLD MYSELF ACCOUNTABLE TO THE TRUTH
