Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks MC is an organization for developing modded minecraft-relevant tooling. Gradle plugins, toolchains, analyzers, utilities etc. Everything except the mods.

Current projects:

* a [Voldeloom](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom/tree/disaster-time) fork, modernized and updated
* [minivan](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/minivan), bare-minimum Gradle plugin for putting vanilla Minecraft on the classpath
