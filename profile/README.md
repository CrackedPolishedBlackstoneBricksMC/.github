# Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks

We develop everything but the mods :tm: 

Current tooling-related projects:

* a [Voldeloom](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom/tree/disaster-time) fork, modernized and updated, for compiling Minecraft Forge 1.3 - 1.7 mods with today's tools
* [minivan](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/minivan), bare-minimum Gradle plugin for putting vanilla Minecraft on the classpath
* [crossroad](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/crossroad), a tool for taking the intersection of two jars (such as minecraft versions)

Currently baking: [toybox](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/toybox), which will be a fully-modular Minecraft toolchain. Incubating some ideas (and pushing against the limits of the mainstream ecosystem plugins!) in [quat1024/mods](https://github.com/quat1024/mods).
